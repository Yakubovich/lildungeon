This is a zombie survival game build using the HTML5 canvas element.
Your objective is to survive and rescue people before they get bitten by zombies.

Todo:

- Original artwork

- Levels that increase in difficulty. A level will have the following attributes:
  - Wall placement
  - Hints (for early levels)
  - Player placement
  - Number of people
  - Number of zombies
  - Probability of new people spawning
  - Number of people spawning
  - Quota of people to rescue
  - Weapon types and spawn probability

- Instead of the score incrementing when a person is picked up, there should be a
  quota of people to rescue, and drop zones that appear when the quota is reached.
  The score should increment only when the people are safely dropped at the zones.

- More weapon types (including grenades and flame throwers)
